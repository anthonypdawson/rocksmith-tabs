rocksmith-tabs
==============

This is a collection of Rocksmith tabs. Currently many only contain the bass parts. Not all are complete.
If you 'd like to contribute new or fixed parts, please do! Submissions are done using pull requests 
(see GitHub help on how to do this) or you can mail me your files and I'll add/update them in the repo.

Rules for submission:
* Only Rocksmith tabs are accepted, standard or DLC
* You can submit both guitar and bass tabs or combos
* To submit a new part to an existing tab, you will have to merge your part into the existing tab file first
* Tab files should be named as the song, with appropriate spaces but without special characters (commas, hyphens, colons etc). NO year, band or album name!
* New tabs must be in Guitar Pro format. If you don't have Guitar Pro, create them with TuxGuitar (free) and then export as GP file
